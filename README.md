Missile Commander is a retro style shooting game inspired by Missile Command(1979). I used Spritekit to implement all the functionalities, pixilart.com to draw sprite textures, Bfxr to mix the sound effects. 
I made this game because I think making a game with a new language is one of the best way to learn that language.

## Goal
The goal of this game is to survive from enemy attack and earn as many score as possible.

If your ability is already at max level, you will get + 10000 score instead.

Item will be mutated every 5 seconds, so you can wait for what you want. But, it will be disappear after mutating 3 times so you have to be careful.

## Difficulty
Enemy attacks will be getting stronger every 30 seconds. Actually, difficulty of this game is designed to eliminate you in about 3 minutes. But if you managed to survive from 3 minutes of intense enemy attack, there will be "Hell" difficulty waiting for you. I'm pretty sure that you CAN NOT survive from it.

## Score
There is a chaining explosion combo system in this game. If you terminate the enemy attack, than it will explode too. So you can chaining these explosions. Combo will be multiply your score. So it really helps you to earn more score.
